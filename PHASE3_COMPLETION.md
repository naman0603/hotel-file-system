# Phase 3 Completion Report

## Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Implemented comprehensive exception handling with custom exception classes
- Added transactional operations for file chunking to maintain data consistency
- Created recovery mechanisms for failed operations

### 2. Redundancy Management
- Developed the RedundancyManager class to handle replica creation and management
- Implemented configurable replication policies with minimum replica thresholds
- Added node distribution awareness to improve fault tolerance

### 3. Integrity Verification
- Added SHA-256 checksum verification for all file chunks
- Implemented automated detection of corrupted or missing chunks
- Created verification workflows that report detailed integrity statistics

### 4. Health Monitoring System
- Designed and implemented a SystemHealth class for monitoring
- Created a user-friendly health dashboard with visual status indicators
- Added file-level and node-level health reporting
- Implemented metrics for overall system health assessment

### 5. File Recovery
- Added automatic restoration of corrupted chunks from replicas
- Implemented repair functionality for files with integrity issues
- Created fallback mechanisms when primary chunks are unavailable

### 6. Management Commands
- Enhanced maintenance commands with integrity verification options
- Added repair capabilities to the command line interface
- Created detailed system statistics reporting

## Issues Encountered and Solutions

1. **Issue**: NoneType error in health dashboard
   **Solution**: Added None-value filtering in the view before processing

2. **Issue**: Django template errors with percentage signs in style attributes
   **Solution**: Fixed template syntax for inline styles with variables

3. **Issue**: Ensuring transaction consistency during chunk operations
   **Solution**: Implemented atomic transactions with proper rollback handling

## Testing Results

- Successfully verified integrity checking with both good and corrupted files
- Confirmed replica creation works across different nodes
- Validated automatic recovery from replicas when chunks are corrupted
- Verified health dashboard correctly displays system status

## Next Steps for Phase 4

1. Implement retrieval optimization from nearest/least-loaded node
2. Add caching for frequently accessed files
3. Enhance user interface and experience
4. Add performance metrics and analytics
5. Implement more advanced security features
