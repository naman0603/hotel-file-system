- Added fallback mechanisms for corrupted or unavailable chunks
- Implemented error recovery during the retrieval process

### 2. Caching System
- Developed an in-memory caching system for frequently accessed files
- Created cache management utilities to track file access patterns
- Implemented a command-line interface for cache management
- Added manual and automatic caching capabilities

### 3. Analytics Dashboard
- Created a comprehensive analytics dashboard for monitoring file access
- Added file access tracking and statistics
- Implemented visual indicators for cached vs. uncached files
- Added node distribution analytics to monitor system load

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Enhanced file download with optimized chunk selection
- Implemented chunk retrieval from nearest or least-loaded nodes
- Added access tracking to identify popular files for proactive caching
- Optimized storage distribution for better load balancing

## Technical Implementation Highlights

1. **NodeSelector Class**: Created an intelligent node selection system that considers factors like node proximity, current load, and health status to choose the optimal node for retrieving chunks.

2. **Optimized File Reassembly**: Implemented a new algorithm that prioritizes retrieving chunks from the most efficient nodes, with automatic fallback to alternatives when issues are detected.

3. **In-Memory Caching**: Built a caching layer that stores frequently accessed files for rapid retrieval, significantly reducing load times for popular content.

4. **Cache Analytics**: Developed tracking mechanisms to monitor cache hits/misses and access patterns, providing valuable insights into system performance.

## Testing Results

- File download speed improved significantly for cached files
- System demonstrates intelligent node selection under various load scenarios
- Error recovery successfully handles corrupted chunks by fetching from alternate nodes
- Analytics dashboard correctly displays file access and caching statistics

## Next Steps and Future Enhancements

1. Implement advanced caching policies based on predictive analytics
2. Add geographic routing for multi-region deployments
3. Implement bandwidth throttling and quality of service features
4. Enhance analytics with advanced visualization and reporting
5. Add user-configurable caching preferences

This phase significantly improves the system's performance and user experience by implementing intelligent retrieval mechanisms and caching. The distributed file storage system now efficiently handles file retrievals with optimized node selection and caching, leading to faster download speeds and reduced system load.
