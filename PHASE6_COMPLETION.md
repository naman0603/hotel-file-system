# Phase 6 Completion Report

## Implemented Features

### 1. Node Availability Verification
- Added a system to check how many storage nodes are available before upload
- Implemented minimum node requirement (at least 2 active servers) for uploads
- Created user-friendly error messages when not enough nodes are available

### 2. Enhanced File Distribution
- Improved file chunking to work with only available nodes
- Optimized chunk placement across active nodes
- Enhanced replica creation to work with available nodes only

### 3. Comprehensive Failover Support
- Implemented robust file reassembly that works even when multiple nodes are down
- Added intelligence to retrieve chunks from replicas when primary nodes are unavailable
- Created prioritization system for chunk retrieval (primary chunks first, then replicas)

### 4. System Resilience
- Files can now be downloaded even when multiple storage servers are unavailable
- System intelligently uses available replicas when primary chunks are inaccessible
- Robust error handling for node failures during upload and download operations

## Technical Implementation

1. **Node Availability Check**: Before uploads, system verifies enough nodes are active to ensure redundancy.

2. **Intelligent Chunk Placement**: During upload, chunks are distributed only to healthy, available nodes.

3. **Optimized Redundancy**: Replicas are created on separate nodes to maximize availability.

4. **Failover Download System**: Enhanced file reassembly to prioritize healthy nodes and use replicas when needed.

5. **Minimum Node Requirements**: System enforces at least 2 active nodes for uploads to ensure redundancy.

## Challenges Overcome

- Developed robust node availability checking mechanism
- Created intelligent failover system for chunk retrieval
- Implemented verification of node health before operations
- Enhanced system to gracefully handle multiple node failures

## Future Enhancements (Phase 7)

For Phase 7, we plan to:
- Add loading indicators for file downloads to improve user experience
- Implement more detailed status messages during file operations
- Enhance error handling with user-friendly messages
- Add performance optimizations for faster file retrieval
